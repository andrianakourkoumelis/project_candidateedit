 <a href="https://malliotakis.house.gov/">Republican Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis </a> currently represents the 11th Congressional District of New York, including Staten Island and parts of Southern Brooklyn. She is running for re-election in 2024. Her policies on health include increasing mental health initiatives, the accessibility of Medicare, providing disability aid, and lowering prescription drug costs through existing and recently announced plans.
    </p>
<div>
<h2>Mental health aid accomplishments and initiatives</h2>
</div>
    <p>
        In 2021 Malliotakis<a href="https://malliotakis.house.gov/media/in-the-news/malliotakis-secures-400k-mental-health-addiction-services-rumc-childrens-trauma">
        raised $400,000 </a> for the Richmond University Medical Center (RUMC) for the children's trauma department. This federal grant was targeted towards children in Staten Island in need of mental health and substance abuse programs. The program is meant to aid individuals between the ages 3 through 21. In 2024, she annouced that she is a cosponsor to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8575/cosponsors"> Michelle Alyssa Go Act, </a> a bipartisan legislation that works to "expand access to psychiatric resources by increasing the number of in-patient psychiatric beds covered by Medicaid from 16 to 36 so long as institutions meet nationally recognized, evidence-based standards of care," according to Malliotakis' announcement. 
    </p>
<div>
<h2>Stance on the "Right to Medicare" Act</h2>
</div>
    <p>
        Malliotakis played a role in reinstating Medicare Part B Coverage and has introduced the <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2023/09/new-legislation-aims-to-prevent-nycs-plan-to-change-city-retirees-healthcare.html">Right to Medicare Act</a> meant to prevent employers from transitioning seniors to Medicare Advantage from Medicare. “New York City Mayor Eric Adams broke the city’s commitment to our civil servants when he forced our retirees to change their health plan without any notice or input,” said Malliotakis when the act was introduced in a press release. 
    </p>
<div>
<h2>Plans to make disability aid accessible</h2>
</div>
    <p> 
        This year, Malliotakis secured<a href="https://malliotakis.house.gov/media/in-the-news/rep-malliotakis-gives-local-disability-organization-large-federal-check"> $750,000</a> through federal funding for the organization Lifestyles for the Disabled based out of Staten Island. This organization works to aid those with developmental disabilities by providing educational programming. Lifestyles for the Disabled plans to purchase more training sites and work towards making them more ADA-compliant through Malliotakis' support. 
    </p>
<div>
<h2>Goal to lower prescription drug costs</h2>
</div>
    <p> 
        This year, Malliotakis annouced a legislative language to raise awareness towards reducing presciption drug costs. The <a href="https://buddycarter.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=11175">Protecting Patients Against PBM Abuses Act </a> would protect pharmacies and patients from pharmacy benefit manager practices that promote the inaccessibility of healthcare essentials, typically by increasing prices.
